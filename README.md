### What?
Dpviz
This is a module for [FreePBX©](http://www.freepbx.org/ "FreePBX Home Page"), an open source graphical user interface to control and manage [Asterisk(http://www.asterisk.org/ "Asterisk Home Page") phone systems.  FreePBX is licensed under GPL.
The dpviz module shows you a graph of the call flow for any Inbound Route.  End-user PBX support often involves making changes to the flow for inbound calls, or simply asking questions about it (e.g. "Whose phones ring when someone calls X?  When we get a call on Y does it go directly to the IVR or are there Time Conditions applied first?").
